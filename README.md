### **Autonomous Robot ðŸ¤–**

### **Overview**

An autonomous robot developed as a end-of-year project to demonstrate skills in robotics, embedded programming, and mechanical design. The robot features a six-wheel drive system for enhanced mobility and a potential LiDAR sensor for navigation and obstacle avoidance. It was designed to operate in complex environments, showcasing my ability to integrate hardware and software for autonomous functionality.

Chassis: 
- Custom-designed in SolidWorks, 3D-printed or CNC-machined

### **Software**

Language: C++
Environment: Arduino IDE
Libraries: To be determined (e.g., RPLIDAR for LiDAR, NewPing for ultrasonic sensors if used)

### **Features (Planned):**

Autonomous navigation using sensor data
Obstacle avoidance with sensor fusion
Data logging or remote control via Wi-Fi (optional)

### **Mechanical Design on SolidWorks**

The robot's chassis was designed using SolidWorks, leveraging my CSWA certification skills. The design includes:

A four wheel drive system for stability and traction on rough terrain.
A modular platform for easy access to electronics and sensors.
A mounting system for the LiDAR sensor to ensure a 360-degree field of view.
